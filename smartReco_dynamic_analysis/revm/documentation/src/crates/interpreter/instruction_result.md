# The `instruction_result.rs` Module

The `instruction_result.rs` module of this Rust EVM implementation includes the definitions of the enumerations `InstructionResult` and `SuccessOrHalt`, which represent the possible outcomes of EVM instruction execution, and functions to work with these types.

## `InstructionResult` Enum

The `InstructionResult` enum categorizes the different types of results that can arise from executing an EVM instruction. This enumeration uses the `#[repr(u8)]` attribute, meaning its variants have an explicit storage representation of an 8-bit unsigned integer.

```rust
pub enum InstructionResult {
    Continue = 0x00,
    Stop = 0x01,
    Return = 0x02,
    SelfDestruct = 0x03,
    Revert = 0x20,
    CallTooDeep = 0x21,
    OutOfFund = 0x22,
    OutOfGas = 0x50,
    // more variants...
}
```

The different instruction results represent outcomes such as successful continuation, stop, return, self-destruction, reversion, deep call, out of funds, out of gas, and various error conditions.

## `SuccessOrHalt` Enum

The `SuccessOrHalt` enum represents the outcome of a transaction execution, distinguishing successful operations, reversion, halting conditions, fatal external errors, and internal continuation. 

```rust
pub enum SuccessOrHalt {
    Success(Eval),
    Revert,
    Halt(Halt),
    FatalExternalError,
    InternalContinue,
}
```

It also provides several methods to check the kind of result and to extract the value of the successful evaluation or halt.

## `From<InstructionResult> for SuccessOrHalt` Implementation

This implementation provides a way to convert an `InstructionResult` into a `SuccessOrHalt`. It maps each instruction result to the corresponding `SuccessOrHalt` variant.

```rust
impl From<InstructionResult> for SuccessOrHalt {
    fn from(result: InstructionResult) -> Self {
        match result {
            InstructionResult::Continue => Self::InternalContinue,
            InstructionResult::Stop => Self::Success(Eval::Stop),
            // more match arms...
        }
    }
}
```

## Macros for returning instruction results

Finally, the module provides two macros, `return_ok!` and `return_revert!`, which simplify returning some common sets of instruction results.

```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! return_ok {
    () => {
        InstructionResult::Continue
            | InstructionResult::Stop
            | InstructionResult::Return
            | InstructionResult::SelfDestruct
    };
}

#[macro_export]
macro_rules! return_revert {
    () => {
        InstructionResult::Revert | InstructionResult::CallTooDeep | InstructionResult::OutOfFund
    };
}
```

In summary, the `instruction_result.rs` module is essential to the interpretation of EVM instructions, as it outlines the possible outcomes and provides means to handle these outcomes within the Rust EVM implementation.
